# Semantic Scout
ComfyUI node to explore the space arround conditionings (CLIP vectors)
https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI

## Instructions
Clone or download the semanticscout.py file and copy to the custom_nodes folder in your ComfyUI installation.

The only parameter is the radius - the distance to the original CLIP vector.

## Tips
Use the Inpire-pack (https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack) *prompt from file* node to create several random examples based on the same prompt. You can use the prompt3.txt file as an example.

A workflow example is also provided.
